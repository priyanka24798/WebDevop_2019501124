# Project 0

By using html and css I have designed my own website.

I choosed  " Career Options " as my website homepage

According to the requirements specified, My website consists of following html pages :

firstwebpage.html which means home page

In this home page I have used Bootstrap for main heading and created four hyperlinks as:

option 1

when we click on each option, it redirects to the other html pages and I have also added back button 
in other html pages so that user can get back to main home page

In each options, I have mentioned about one feild of career , Included description, eligibility, oppurtunities

Added stylesheet using css in all the html pages to make my website to look effectively.
