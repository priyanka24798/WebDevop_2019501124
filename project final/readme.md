By using html and css I have designed my own website.

I choosed " Career Options " as my website homepage

According to the requirements specified, My website consists of following html pages :

homepage.html which means home page

In this home page I have used Bootstrap for main heading and created four hyperlinks 



when we click on each option, it redirects to the other html pages and I have also added back button in other html pages so that user can get back to main home page

In each options, I have given details about career options after 10 th and after 12th

And in remaining links I have mentioned about one feild of career.

Added stylesheet using css in all the html pages to make my website to look effectively.

some of the properties of css that i have used :

font , color, background, font style, width, height etc.,

Used @media query for my home page so that it becomes mobile -responsive

Also, used bootstrap layout and bootstrap components

Installed scss and used properties like variable, nesting, inheritence
